Compiled styles (pull in all scss files, exported unminified for development, minified for production)

// Previously, development used all files with content as separate <link> tags in index.html
// However, that did not allow @extend of base.scss styles
// Because Chrome dev tools are able to show individual scss source files, even when only a single css file is used,
// this sheet is now the only one used for both development & production
